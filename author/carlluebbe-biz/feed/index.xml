<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-personal-introduction">Personal Introduction</h2>



<p>As a lifelong Libertarian and the author of this article, I consider mandates such as mask-wearing to be akin to seatbelt laws, or regulations against any behavior that is not <em>immediately </em>life-threatening. However, common sense should prevail in public health, especially during crises like the COVID-19 pandemic. We must educate ourselves in order to make sound decisions with less interference, whether that interference is from governments, large corporations, or politicians exploiting the poorly educated by misrepresenting basic science. In this article, we will address some of the misinformation that has circulated regarding the role of N95 respirators.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-efficacy-of-n95-respirators-against-covid-19-the-science">The Efficacy of N95 Respirators Against COVID-19: The Science</h2>



<p>The global fight against COVID-19 has spotlighted the crucial role of N95 respirators. Understanding how these masks work provides clarity on their effectiveness and dispels prevalent myths. Let’s delve into the science behind each of their key functional aspects. N95 masks boast a filtration efficiency of 95% or higher, by targeting the larger droplets containing COVID virions. Recognized globally by health authorities like the CDC (US), PHAC (Canada), and others, there&#8217;s unanimous agreement on their effectiveness in curbing COVID-19 spread. No reputable health organization has opposed their use.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-filtration-of-larger-particles">1. Filtration of Larger Particles</h3>



<p>N95 masks are engineered to filter out 95% of particles that are 0.3 microns or larger. However, their efficacy extends beyond just the size filtration:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Particle Attachment</strong>: A significant portion of the virus-laden particles are expelled in respiratory droplets, which are generally larger than 5 microns. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) explains that these droplets are the primary means of COVID-19 transmission.</li>



<li><strong>Effectiveness</strong>: While the exact percentage varies, studies like this one from the Journal of Aerosol Science indicate that N95 masks are highly effective in capturing these larger particles, thereby significantly reducing the transmission of virus-laden droplets.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-n95-respirator-electrostatic-charge">2. N95 Respirator Electrostatic Charge</h3>



<p>One of the less discussed but vital features of N95 masks is their electrostatic nature:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>How It Works</strong>: The fibers in N95 masks are manufactured to have an electrostatic charge. As explained by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), this charge enhances the filtration efficiency by attracting airborne particles.</li>



<li><strong>Mechanism of Attraction</strong>: This electrostatic attraction ensures that particles smaller than the mask&#8217;s physical pore size are still effectively captured, as detailed in research published in ACS Nano.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-brownian-motion">3. Brownian Motion</h3>



<p>Brownian motion plays a subtle yet crucial role in the effectiveness of N95 masks.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Principle Theory</strong>: Brownian motion refers to the random movement of particles suspended in a fluid (like air). This concept, fundamental to physics and explained in resources like Khan Academy’s science lessons, shows that smaller particles move erratically.</li>



<li><strong>Impact on Filtration</strong>: This erratic movement increases the likelihood of small particles, such as virions, colliding with and being captured by the mask fibers. The Journal of Occupational and Environmental Hygiene provides insights into how this motion enhances the filtering efficiency for small particles.</li>



<li><strong>The Explain it Like I&#8217;m Five version</strong>: Imagine you have a tiny speck of dust floating in a glass of water. Even though you&#8217;re not touching it, you can see it moving around on its own. That&#8217;s because invisible tiny things in the water are always bumping into the speck, making it wiggle and move in different directions. It&#8217;s like the speck is playing a game of tag with the invisible water molecules, and it can go in any direction because it&#8217;s getting bumped from all sides. This wiggling and jiggling of tiny particles is what we call Brownian motion.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-adoption-of-n95-respirator-protocols-during-the-pandemic">Adoption of N95 Respirator Protocols During the Pandemic</h2>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-similarities-in-symbolism">Similarities in Symbolism</h2>



<p>The unicursal hexagram of Thelema and the Eastern Yin Yang symbol offer insightful philosophical parallels with the intriguing principles of quantum physics, particularly resonating with Niels Bohr’s concept of complementarity. This union gives birth to technoshamanism.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-yin-yang-and-quantum-theory"><strong>The Yin Yang and Quantum Theory:</strong></h2>



<p>In the Yin Yang’s flowing, interconnected nature, we see a reflection of the unicursal hexagram’s depiction of inseparable, opposing forces. This symbolic resonance is mirrored in the realm of quantum theory, where subatomic particles exist in a probabilistic haze, oscillating between contradictory states such as wave and particle, influenced by observation. This phenomenon of quantum indeterminacy collapsing upon measurement parallels the Yin Yang, which beautifully illustrates the interdependence and mutual definition of seemingly opposite forces.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-unicursal-hexagram-and-connection-of-opposites"><strong>The Unicursal Hexagram and Connection of Opposites</strong></h2>



<p>The unicursal hexagram, representing the unity of opposites, resonates deeply with the principles of technoshamanism. This symbol&#8217;s depiction of interconnected forces is reflective of how technoshamanism aims to merge the mystical with the technological, suggesting that the ancient wisdom embodied in such symbols can inform and enrich our understanding of modern scientific concepts.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-heisenberg-s-uncertainty-and-symbolic-parallels"><strong>Heisenberg’s Uncertainty and Symbolic Parallels:</strong></h2>



<p>Moreover, Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, states that precision in measuring one quantum property inherently limits knowledge of its complement. This concept finds a symbolic parallel in the Yin Yang, where each aspect contains and engenders the other in a perpetual, interwoven dance.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-transcending-dualism"><strong>Transcending Dualism:</strong></h2>



<p>Additionally, both the unicursal hexagram and the Yin Yang transcend traditional dualistic perspectives. They reflect the counterintuitive nature of the quantum world, where particles don’t possess a singular, defined state but exist across a spectrum of probable characteristics. This aligns with a holistic view, moving beyond binary divisions to embrace a complex interplay of complementary forces. These symbols and quantum principles collectively challenge the classical, deterministic understanding of the universe, advocating for a more probabilistic and paradoxical interpretation. The unicursal hexagram and Yin Yang symbolize that apparent contradictions in existence are not at odds but rather form an interconnected, nuanced whole. They exemplify how opposites are generative, not negating, weaving together the complex tapestry of existence. Embracing these relationships, as illustrated by both symbols, aligns us with the harmonious nature of the universe, echoing the counterintuitive insights of the uncertainty principle.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-thelema-s-principle-of-0-2"><strong>Thelema’s Principle of 0=2:</strong></h2>



<p>The Thelemic principle of 0=2, deeply rooted in Aleister Crowley’s mystical system, provides a unique philosophical underpinning that complements the themes discussed in this article. At its core, this principle embodies the concept of unity emerging from duality, a fundamental tenet in Thelemic philosophy. The equation 0=2, in Thelemic thought, symbolizes the idea that the apparent duality of existence (represented by 2) ultimately originates from and returns to a state of non-duality or nothingness (represented by 0). This aligns closely with the concepts in quantum physics, where the seemingly dual nature of particles, as both waves and particles, emerges from a singular, undifferentiated quantum field. Just as the unicursal hexagram and Yin Yang depict the inseparable interplay of opposites, the principle of 0=2 in Thelema suggests that all dualities — light and dark, creation and destruction, positive and negative — are intrinsically connected, emanating from a singular source.</p>

<p>In the context of quantum mechanics, one can draw parallels between the Thelemic principle of 0=2 and the wave-particle duality. Just as the 0 represents the undifferentiated, unified field, the number 2 reflects the dual nature of quantum entities. This duality is not a permanent state but rather a manifestation of the underlying unity. It reflects the much like the quantum state of a particle, not fixed until it is observed. This aligns with the Thelemic view that apparent dualities are merely different expressions of a single, underlying reality. Moreover, the principle of 0=2 resonates with the idea of quantum superposition, where particles exist in multiple states simultaneously until measured. In Thelemic philosophy, this can be seen as the myriad manifestations of the universe (the number 2) emerging from the void or the absence of existence (0). It suggests that the universe’s complexities, including its paradoxes and contradictions, are integral aspects of a unified whole, challenging our conventional understanding of separation and distinction.</p>

<p>This philosophical exploration leads us to consider the significant role of metrics in confirming the existence of phenomena, a concept deeply rooted in both quantum mechanics and the interpretation of symbols. In quantum physics, the very act of measuring a particle’s properties – position, momentum, or spin – solidifies its existence in a specific state, transitioning it from a probability to a reality. This principle aligns with the symbolism of the unicursal hexagram and Yin Yang, where the definition of one aspect inherently confirms the existence of its counterpart. Just as the measurement of a quantum particle’s position simultaneously acknowledges the existence of its momentum, the presence of Yin intrinsically confirms the existence of Yang. This interplay of measurement and existence underpins both the mystic symbolism of these ancient icons and the empirical foundations of quantum mechanics, illustrating a profound unity between philosophical concepts and scientific principles. The existence of a metric, be it in physical measurements or symbolic interpretations, serves as a bridge between potentiality and reality, reinforcing the notion that our understanding and observation are integral to the manifestation of existence itself.</p>

<p>Quantum physics, often perceived as a mystical domain due to its counterintuitive principles, aligns well with the technoshamanic perspective. This field&#8217;s exploration of particles existing in multiple states aligns with the technoshamanic belief in the coexistence of spiritual and physical realms. It posits that technology, when applied with an understanding of shamanic wisdom, can unlock new dimensions of understanding, similar to how the Yin Yang symbol encapsulates the duality yet unity of existence.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-technoshamanism-merging-ancient-mysticism-with-modern-technology">Technoshamanism: Merging Ancient Mysticism with Modern Technology</h2>



<p>Technoshamanism is a contemporary concept that fuses the ancient practices of shamanism with the advancements of modern technology and science. It embodies the idea that the spiritual insights and rituals of shamans, when integrated with the empirical approach of technology and quantum physics, can lead to a deeper, more holistic understanding of reality. Technoshamans utilize both the symbolic wisdom of traditions, like the unicursal hexagram and the Yin Yang, and the empirical data of quantum mechanics, proposing that this synthesis can offer a more nuanced and interconnected view of the universe. This approach suggests a harmonious blend of spiritual intuition and scientific inquiry, bridging the gap between metaphysical beliefs and technological advancements.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-conclusion">Conclusion:</h2>



<p>In conclusion, the integration of the unicursal hexagram, Yin Yang, and quantum principles presents a compelling view of reality. These concepts advocate for a universe understood not in terms of isolated absolutes but as a network of relational dynamics and potentials. They encourage transcending perceived divisions, viewing existence as a unified, complementary dance. This convergence of ancient symbolism and modern physics suggests a profound truth: existence is fundamentally an interplay of harmonious opposites, a concept now increasingly validated by the advances in quantum mechanics.</p>
